# Personal Job Search OS

A private, single-user job search and interview preparation tool.

Discovers relevant SDE-2 / SWE-2 openings at target companies as early as possible, surfaces the
referral contacts who can help, generates the outreach message, and tracks the application through
to interviews — in one place, on free infrastructure.

## Status

Phase 0, milestone M0 (foundation). See [`docs/progress.md`](docs/progress.md).

## Stack

Next.js 16 on Cloudflare Workers (`@opennextjs/cloudflare`) · Cloudflare D1 + Drizzle · Python 3.12 crawlers on
GitHub Actions · Cloudflare Access · Gmail SMTP.

There is no Go backend, despite the PRD proposing one — it is incompatible with D1 and free
Cloudflare hosting. See [ADR 002](docs/decisions/002-typescript-on-workers.md).
